#
# The patterns are sorted as follows within each size, with the primary
# criterium first: 
#
# 1. Edge and corner specific patterns.
# 2. Number of rows, lowest first.
# 3. Number of marginal vertices.
# 4. Number of possible eyes
#
# In addition to 2, there is also the requirement that all patterns
# with the same topology come together. E.g. among the four vertices,
# two rows patterns, those with topology
#
#  .
# ...
#
# come together and those with topology
#
# ..
# ..
#
# follows later.
#
# Similarly, in addition to 3, patterns with the same configuration of
# marginal vertices are grouped together.
#
# To make best use of the "x" wildcard, it is occasionally
# advantageous to have a specific exceptional pattern before a more
# general one. In these cases criterium 4 above may be violated.
#
# #######
#
# The colon line below the pattern gives the eye value of the matched
# eye shape. This consists of four digits, each of which is the number
# of eyes obtained during the following conditions:
#
# 1. The attacker moves first and is allowed yet another move because
#    the defender plays tenuki.
# 2. The attacker moves first and the defender responds locally.
# 3. The defender moves first and the attacker responds locally.
# 4. The defender moves first and is allowed yet another move because
#    the attacker plays tenuki.
#
# Notice that 1 does not necessarily mean that the attacker is
# allowed two consecutive moves. This is explained with an example
# later.
#
# Also, since two eyes suffice to live, all higher numbers also count
# as two.
#
# The following 15 cases are of interest:
#
# 0000   0 eyes.
# 0001   0 eyes, but the defender can threaten to make one eye.
# 0002   0 eyes, but the defender can threaten to make two eyes.
# 0011   1/2 eye, 1 eye if defender moves first, 0 eyes if attacker does.
# 0012   3/4 eyes, 3/2 eyes if defender moves first, 0 eyes if attacker does.
# 0022   1* eye, 2 eyes if defender moves first, 0 eyes if attacker does.
# 0111   1 eye, attacker can threaten to destroy the eye.
# 0112   1 eye, attacker can threaten to destroy the eye,
#               defender can threaten to make another eye.
# 0122   5/4 eyes, 2 eyes if defender moves first, 1/2 eye if attacker does.
# 0222   2 eyes, attacker can threaten to destroy both.
# 1111   1 eye.
# 1112   1 eye, defender can threaten to make another eye.
# 1122   3/2 eyes, 2 eyes if defender moves first, 1 eye if attacker does.
# 1222   2 eyes, attacker can threaten to destroy one eye.
# 2222   2 eyes.
#
# The 3/4, 5/4, and 1* eye values are the same as in Howard Landman's paper
# Eyespace Values in Go. Attack and defense points are only marked in
# the patterns when they have definite effects on the eye value,
# i.e. pure threats are not marked.
#
#
# Examples of all different cases can be found among the patterns in
# this file. Some of them might be slightly counterintuitive, so we
# explain one important case here. Consider
# 
# Pattern 6141
# 
#  X
# XX.@x
# 
# :1122
#
# which e.g. matches in this position:
#
# .OOOXXX
# OOXOXOO
# OXXba.O
# OOOOOOO
#
# Now it may look like X could take away both eyes by playing a
# followed by b, giving 0122 as eye value. This is where the subtlety
# of the definition of the first digit in the eye value comes into
# play. It does not say that the attacker is allowed two consecutive
# moves but only that he is allowed to play "another move". The
# crucial property of this shape is that when X plays at a to destroy
# (at least) one eye, O can answer at b, giving:
#
# .OOOXXX
# OO.OXOO
# O.cOX.O
# OOOOOOO
#
# Now X has to continue at c in order to keep O at one eye. After this
# O plays tenuki and X cannot destroy the remaining eye by another
# move. Thus the eye value is indeed 1122.
#
#
# As a final note, some of the eye values indicating a threat depend
# on suicide to be allowed, e.g.
#
# Pattern 301
# 
# X.X
# 
# :1222
#
# We always assume suicide to be allowed in this database. It is easy
# enough to sort out such moves at a higher level when suicide is
# disallowed.
