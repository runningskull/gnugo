@cindex installation

Untar the sources, change to the directory gnugo-3.6. Now do:

@example
   ./configure [OPTIONS]
   make
@end example

Several configure options will be explained in the next section. You do not
need to set these unless you are dissatisfied with GNU Go's performance or
wish to vary the experimental options.

As an example,

@example
   ./configure --enable-level=9 --enable-cosmic-gnugo
@end example

@noindent
will make a binary in which the default level is 9, and the experimental
``cosmic''' option is enabled. A list of all configure options can be
obtained by running @command{./configure --help}. Further information
about the experimental options can be found in the next section
(@pxref{Configure Options}).

After running configure and make, you have now made a binary called
@file{interface/gnugo}. Now (running as root) type

@example
   make install
@end example

@noindent
to install @file{gnugo} in @file{/usr/local/bin}.

There are different methods of using GNU Go. You may run it from the
command line by just typing:

@example
   gnugo
@end example

@noindent
but it is nicer to run it using CGoban 1 (under X Window System), Jago
(on any platform with a Java Runtime Environment) or other
client programs offering a GUI.

You can get the most recent version of CGoban 1 from 
@url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/cgoban1/}. The earlier version
1.12 is available from @url{http://www.igoweb.org/~wms/comp/cgoban/index.html}.
The CGoban version number MUST be 1.9.1 at least or it won't work. CGoban 2
will not work.

@node Configure Options
@section Configure Options

There are three options which you should consider configuring,
particularly if you are dissatisfied with GNU Go's performance.

@menu
* Ram Cache::                 Ram Cache
* Default Level::             Default Level
* Other Options::             Other Options
@end menu

@node Ram Cache
@subsection Ram Cache

By default, GNU Go makes a cache of 8 Megabytes in RAM for its
internal use. The cache is used to store intermediate results during
its analysis of the position.

Increasing the cache size will often give a modest speed improvement.
If your system has lots of RAM, consider increasing the cache
size. But if the cache is too large, swapping will occur,
causing hard drive accesses and degrading performance. If
your hard drive seems to be running excessively your cache
may be too large. On GNU/Linux systems, you may detect swapping
using the program 'top'. Use the 'f' command to toggle SWAP
display.

You may override the size of the default cache at compile time 
by running one of:

@example
   ./configure --enable-cache-size=n
@end example

@noindent
to set the cache size to @code{n} megabytes. For example

@example
   ./configure --enable-cache-size=32
@end example

@noindent
creates a cache of size 32 megabytes. If you omit this, your default
cache size will be 8 MB. You must recompile and reinstall
GNU Go after reconfiguring it by running @command{make} and
@command{make install}.

You may override the compile-time defaults by running @file{gnugo}
with the option @option{--cache-size n}, where @code{n} is the size in
megabytes of the cache you want, and @option{--level} where n is the
level desired.  We will discuss setting these parameters next in
detail.

@node Default Level
@subsection Default Level

GNU Go can play at different levels. Up to level 10 is
supported. At level 10 GNU Go is much more accurate but takes
an average of about 1.6 times longer to play than at level 8.

The level can be set at run time using the @option{--level} option.
If you don't set this, the default level will be used. You
can set the default level with the configure option
@option{--enable-level=n}. For example

@example
./configure --enable-level=9
@end example

@noindent
sets the default level to 9. If you omit this parameter,
the compiler sets the default level to 10. We recommend
using level 10 unless you find it too slow. If you decide
you want to change the default you may rerun configure
and recompile the program.

@node Other Options
@subsection Other Options

Anything new in the engine is generally tested as an experimental option
which can be turned on or off at compile time or run time. Some
``experimental'' options such as the break-in code are no longer
experimental but are enabled by default.

This section can be skipped unless you are interested in the
experimental options.

Moreover, some configure options were removed from the stable
release. For example it is known that the owl extension code
can cause crashes, so the configure option --enable-experimental-owl-ext
was disabled for 3.6.

The term ``default'' must be clarified, since there
are really two sets of defaults at hand, runtime defaults
specified in @file{config.h} and compile time default
values for the runtime defaults, contained in @file{configure}
(which is created by editing @file{configure.in} then running
@command{autoconf}. For example we find in @file{config.h}

@example
/* Center oriented influence. Disabled by default. */
#define COSMIC_GNUGO 0

/* Break-in module. Enabled by default. */
#define USE_BREAK_IN 1
@end example

This means that the experimental cosmic option, which causes
GNU Go to play a center-oriented game (and makes the engine
weaker) is disabled by default, but that the break-in module
is used. These are defaults which are used when GNU Go is
run without command line options. They can be overridden
with the run time options:

@example
gnugo --cosmic-gnugo --without-break-in
@end example

Alternatively you can configure GNU Go as follows:

@example
./configure --enable-cosmic-gnugo --disable-experimental-break-in
@end example

then recompile GNU Go. This changes the defaults in @file{config.h},
so that you do not have to pass any command line options to GNU Go
at run time to get the experimental owl extension turned on and
the experimental break-in code turned off.

If you want to find out what experimental options were compiled into your GNU
Go binary you can run @command{gnugo --options} to find out. Here is a list
of experimental options in GNU Go.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{experimental-break-in}. Experimental break-in code
(@pxref{Break Ins}). You should not need to configure this because
the break in code is enabled by default in level 10, and is turned
off at level 9. If you don't want the breakin code just play at
level 9.
@item @code{cosmic-gnugo}. An experimental style which plays a center
oriented game and has a good winning rate against standard GNU Go,
though it makes GNU Go weaker against other opponents.
@item @code{large-scale}. Attempt to make large-scale captures.
See @url{http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnugo-devel/2003-07/msg00209.html}
for the philosophy of this option. This option makes the engine slower.
@item @code{metamachine}. Enables the metamachine, which allows
you to run the engine in an experimental mode whereby it forks
a new @code{gnugo} process which acts as an ``oracle.'' Has no
effect unless combined with the @option{--metamachine} run-time
option.
@end itemize

Other options are not experimental, and can be changed as
configure or runtime options.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{chinese-rules} Use Chinese (area) counting.
@item @code{resignation-allowed} Allow GNU Go to resign games.
This is on by default.
@end itemize

@node Windows and MS-DOS, Macintosh, Configure Options, Installation
@section Compiling GNU Go on Microsoft platforms

GNU Go is being developed on Unix variants. GNU Go is easy to build
and install on those platforms. GNU Go 3.6 has support for building
on MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, Windows NT/2000 and Windows 95/98.

There are two approaches to building GNU Go on Microsoft platforms.

@enumerate
@item 
The first approach is to install a Unix-like environment based
on ports of GCC to Microsoft platforms. This approach is fully
supported by the GNU Go developers and works well. Several
high quality free Unix-environments for Microsoft platforms
are available.

One benefit of this approach is that it is easier to
participate in GNU Go's development. These unix environments
come for instance with the `diff' and `patch' programs
necessary to generate and apply patches.

Another benefit of the unix environments is that development
versions (which may be stronger than the latest stable
version) can be built too.  The supporting files for VC are
not always actively worked on and consequently are often out
of sync for development versions, so that VC will not build
cleanly.

@item
The second approach is to use compilers such as Visual C
developed specially for the Microsoft platform. GNU Go 2.6
and later support Visual C. Presently we support Visual C
through the project files which are supplied with the 
distribution.
@end enumerate

The rest of this section gives more details on the various ways
to compile GNU go for Microsoft platforms.

@menu Using free Unix-environments and GCC
* DJGPP::      Windows 95/98, MS-DOS and Windows 3.x using DJGPP
* Cygwin::     Windows NT, 95/98 using Cygwin
* MinGW32::    Windows NT, 95/98 using MINGW32
* VC::         Visual C++ using Project Files
@end menu

@node DJGPP
@subsection Windows 95/98, MS-DOS and Windows 3.x using DJGPP

On these platforms DJGPP can be used. GNU Go installation has been
tested in a DOS-Box with long filenames on Windows 95/98. GNU Go
compiles out-of-the box with the DJGPP port of GCC using the
standard Unix build and install procedure.

Some URLs for DJGPP:

DJGPP home page: @url{http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/}

DJGPP ftp archive on simtel:

@url{ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2/}

@url{ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2gnu/}

Once you have a working DJGPP environment and you have downloaded
the GNU Go source available as gnugo-3.6.tar.gz you can build the
executable as follows:

@example
       tar zxvf gnugo-3.6.tar.gz
       cd gnugo-3.6
       ./configure
       make
@end example

Optionally you can download glib for DJGPP to get a working version
of snprintf.

@node Cygwin
@subsection Windows NT, 2000, XP, 95/98/ME using Cygwin

Cygwin is a full fledged and rapidly maturing unix environment on top of
windows. Cygwin installs very easily with the interactive setup program
available from the cygwin homepage at @url{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/}.
In fact precompiled versions of stable GNU go releases as well as of the cgoban
X11 GUI can be downloaded through Cygwin's setup. Cygwin's setup also provides
precompiled packages of most of the unix tools necessary to participate in
development.

If you want to build GNU Go yourself make sure to download the ncurses packages
prior to building GNU go. GNU Go compiles out-of-the box using the standard
Unix build procedure on the Cygwin environment. After installation of cygwin
and fetching @file{gnugo-3.6.tar.gz} you can type:

@example
  tar zxvf gnugo-3.6.tar.gz
  cd gnugo-3.6
  ./configure
  make
@end example

The generated executable is not a stand-alone executable: it needs
cygwin1.dll that comes with the Cygwin environment. cygwin1.dll
contains the emulation layer for Unix.

@node MinGW32, VC, Cygwin, Windows and MS-DOS
@subsection Windows NT, 2000, XP, 95/98/ME using MinGW32

The Cygwin environment also comes with MinGW32. The mingw32 platform generates
an executable that relies only on Microsoft DLLs. This executable is thus
completely comparable to a Visual C executable and easier to distribute than
the Cygwin executable. To build on cygwin an executable suitable for the win32
platform type the following at your cygwin prompt:

@example
  tar zxvf gnugo-3.6.tar.gz
  cd gnugo-3.6
  env CC='gcc -mno-cygwin' ./configure
  make
@end example

The generated executable can be reduced in size significantly by
using the upx compression program that is available through
Cygwin's setup program.

@node VC
@subsection Windows NT, Windows 95/98 using Visual C and project files

We assume that you do not want to change any configure options.
If you do, you should edit the file @file{config.vc}. Note that
when @command{configure} is run, this file is overwritten with
the contents of @file{config.vcin}, so you may also want to edit
@file{config.vcin}, though the instructions below do not have
you running @command{configure}.

@enumerate
@item Open the VC++ 6 workspace file gnugo.dsw
@item Set the gnugo project as the active project (right-click on it,
and select "Set as Active Project".  Select 'Build' from the main 
menu, then select 'Build gnugo.exe', this will make all of the 
runtime subprojects.
@end enumerate

Notes:

@itemize @bullet
@item 
a) The build can also be done from the command line:
@example   
    msdev gnugo.dsw /make "gnugo - Win32 Release"
@end example
@item 
b) The default configuration is 'Debug', build the optimized
version by selecting 'Build' from the main menu , then select
'Set active Configuration' and click on 'gnugo - Win32 Release'.
See the Visual Studio help for more on project configurations.
@item 
c) A custom build step in the first dependent subproject (utils)
copys config.vc to config.h in the root directory. If you want
to modify config.h, copy any changes to config.vc. In
particular if you want to change the default level
or default cache size, whose significance is discussed in
@xref{GNU/Linux and Unix}, you must edit this file.
@item
d) This project was built and tested using VC version 6.0.
It has not been tested, and will most likely not work with
earlier versions of VC.
@item
@end itemize

@subsection Running GNU Go on Windows NT and Windows 95/98

GNU Go does not come with its own graphical user interface. The Java
client jago can be used.

To run Jago you need a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This can
be obtained from @url{http://www.javasoft.com/}.  This is the runtime
part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and consists of the Java
virtual machine, Java platform core classes, and supporting files.
The Java virtual machine that comes with I.E. 5.0 works also.

Jago: @url{http://www.rene-grothmann.de/jago/}

@enumerate
@item Invoke GNU Go with @command{gnugo --quiet --mode gmp}
@item Run @command{gnugo --help} from a cygwin or DOS window for a list of
options
@item optionally specify @command{--level <level>} to make the game faster
@end enumerate

Jago works well with both the Cygwin and MinGW32 executables. The
DJGPP executable also works, but has some problems in the interaction
with jago after the game has been finished and scored.

@node Macintosh
@section Macintosh

If you have Mac OS X you can build GNU Go using Apple's compiler, 
which is derived from GCC.
