The standard purpose of regression testing is to avoid getting the same
bug twice. When a bug is found, the programmer fixes the bug and adds a
test to the test suite. The test should fail before the fix and pass
after the fix. When a new version is about to be released, all the tests
in the regression test suite are run and if an old bug reappears, this
will be seen quickly since the appropriate test will fail.

The regression testing in GNU Go is slightly different. A typical test
case involves specifying a position and asking the engine what move it
would make. This is compared to one or more correct moves to decide
whether the test case passes or fails. It is also stored whether a test
case is expected to pass or fail, and deviations in this status signify
whether a change has solved some problem and/or broken something
else. Thus the regression tests both include positions highlighting some
mistake being done by the engine, which are waiting to be fixed, and
positions where the engine does the right thing, where we want to detect
if a change breaks something.

@node Regression Testing
@section Regression testing in GNU Go

Regression testing is performed by the files in the @file{regression/}
directory. The tests are specified as GTP commands in files with the
suffix @file{.tst}, with corresponding correct results and expected
pass/fail status encoded in GTP comments following the test. To run a
test suite the shell scripts @file{test.sh}, @file{eval.sh}, and
@code{regress.sh} can be used. There are also Makefile targets to do
this. If you @command{make all_batches} most of the tests are run.

Game records used by the regression tests are stored in the
directory @file{regression/games/} and its subdirectories.

@node Test Suites
@section Test suites

The regression tests are grouped into suites and stored in files as GTP
commands. A part of a test suite can look as follows:
@example
@group
# Connecting with ko at B14 looks best. Cutting at D17 might be
# considered. B17 (game move) is inferior.
loadsgf games/strategy25.sgf 61
90 gg_genmove black
#? [B14|D17]

# The game move at P13 is a suicidal blunder.
loadsgf games/strategy25.sgf 249
95 gg_genmove black
#? [!P13]

loadsgf games/strategy26.sgf 257
100 gg_genmove black
#? [M16]*
@end group
@end example

Lines starting with a hash sign, or in general anything following a hash
sign, are interpreted as comments by the GTP mode and thus ignored by
the engine. GTP commands are executed in the order they appear, but only
those on numbered lines are used for testing. The comment lines starting
with @code{#?} are magical to the regression testing scripts and
indicate correct results and expected pass/fail status. The string
within brackets is matched as a regular expression against the response
from the previous numbered GTP command. A particular useful feature of
regular expressions is that by using @samp{|} it is possible to specify
alternatives. Thus @code{B14|D17} above means that if either @code{B14}
or @code{D17} is the move generated in test case 90, it passes. There is
one important special case to be aware of. If the correct result string
starts with an exclamation mark, this is excluded from the regular
expression but afterwards the result of the matching is negated. Thus
@code{!P13} in test case 95 means that any move except @code{P13} is
accepted as a correct result.

In test case 100, the brackets on the @code{#?} line is followed by an
asterisk. This means that the test is expected to fail. If there is no
asterisk, the test is expected to pass. The brackets may also be
followed by a @samp{&}, meaning that the result is ignored. This is
primarily used to report statistics, e.g. how many tactical reading
nodes were spent while running the test suite.

@node Performance Testing
@section Performing tests

@code{./test.sh blunder.tst} runs the tests in @file{blunder.tst} and
prints the results of the commands on numbered lines, which may look
like:

@example
1 E5
2 F9
3 O18
4 B7
5 A4
6 E4
7 E3
8 A3
9 D9
10 J9
11 B3
12 C6
13 C6
@end example

This is usually not very informative, however. More interesting is
@code{./eval.sh blunder.tst} which also compares the results above
against the correct ones in the test file and prints a report for each
test on the form:

@example
1 failed: Correct '!E5', got 'E5'
2 failed: Correct 'C9|H9', got 'F9'
3 PASSED
4 failed: Correct 'B5|C5|C4|D4|E4|E3|F3', got 'B7'
5 PASSED
6 failed: Correct 'D4', got 'E4'
7 PASSED
8 failed: Correct 'B4', got 'A3'
9 failed: Correct 'G8|G9|H8', got 'D9'
10 failed: Correct 'G9|F9|C7', got 'J9'
11 failed: Correct 'D4|E4|E5|F4|C6', got 'B3'
12 failed: Correct 'D4', got 'C6'
13 failed: Correct 'D4|E4|E5|F4', got 'C6'
@end example

The result of a test can be one of four different cases:

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{passed}: An expected pass

This is the ideal result.

@item @code{PASSED}: An unexpected pass

This is a result that we are hoping for when we fix a bug. An old test
case that used to fail is now passing. 

@item @code{failed}: An expected failure

The test failed but this was also what we expected, unless we were
trying to fix the particular mistake highlighted by the test case.
These tests show weaknesses of the GNU Go engine and are good places to
search if you want to detect an area which needs improvement.

@item @code{FAILED}: An unexpected failure

This should nominally only happen if something is broken by a
change. However, sometimes GNU Go passes a test, but for the wrong
reason or for a combination of wrong reasons.  When one of these reasons
is fixed, the other one may shine through so that the test suddenly
fails. When a test case unexpectedly fails, it is necessary to make a
closer examination in order to determine whether a change has broken
something.

@end itemize

If you want a less verbose report, @code{./regress.sh . blunder.tst}
does the same thing as the previous command, but only reports unexpected
results. The example above is compressed to

@example
3 unexpected PASS!
5 unexpected PASS!
7 unexpected PASS!
@end example

For convenience the tests are also available as makefile targets. For
example, @code{make blunder} runs the tests in the blunder test suite by
executing @code{eval.sh blunder.tst}. @code{make test} runs all test
suites in a sequence using the @code{regress.sh} script.

@node HTML Views
@section HTML Regression Views

Extremely useful HTML Views of the regression tests may be
produced using two perl scripts @file{regression/regress.pl}
and @file{regression/regress.plx}.

@enumerate
@item The driver program (regress.pl) which:
@itemize @bullet
@item Runs the regression tests, invoking GNU Go.
@item Captures the trace output, board position, and pass/fail status,
sgf output, and dragon status information.
@end itemize
@item The interface to view the captured output (regress.plx) which:
@itemize @bullet
@item Never invokes GNU Go.
@item Displays the captured output in helpful formats (i.e. HTML).
@end itemize
@end enumerate

@subsection Setting up the HTML regression Views

This documentation assumes an apache configured as per Debian's Apache 1.3
distribution, but it should be fairly close to the config for other
distributions.

First, you will need to configure Apache to run CGI scripts in the directory
you wish to serve the html views from.  To do this, add the following to
@file{/etc/apache/httpd.conf} (or to a user-specific conf file if applicable):

@example
<Directory /path/to/script/>
    Options +ExecCGI
</Directory>
@end example

This allows CGI scripts to be executed in the directory used by regress.plx.
Next, you need to tell Apache that @file{.plx} is a CGI script ending.  Your
@file{httpd.conf} file should contain a section @code{<IfModule mod_mime.c>}.
Within that section, there may or may not be a line:

@code{AddHandler cgi-script ....}

If there isn't already, add it; add @file{.plx} to the list of extensions.

You will also need to make sure you have the necessary modules loaded to run
CGI scripts; mod_cgi and mod_mime should be sufficient.  Your @file{httpd.conf}
should have the relevant @code{LoadModule} lines; uncomment them if neccessary.

Next, you need to put a copy of @file{regress.plx} in the directory that you
plan to serve the html views from.

You will also need to install the Perl module GD, available from CPAN or via
@code{apt-get install libgd-perl} on Debian.

Finally, run @file{regression/regress.pl} to create the xml data used to
generate the html views; then, copy the @file{html/} directory to the same
directory as @file{regress.plx} resides in.

At this point, you should have a working copy of the html regression views.
